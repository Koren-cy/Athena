The machine instructions of CPU A are categorized into three groups, I1, I2 and I3. The execution time of a single instruction in each group is as follows. I1: 1 clock cycle I2: 3 clock cycles I3: Memory access instructions, each of which causes a cache hit or a cache miss. In case of a cache hit, an instruction spends 10 clock cycles. In case of a cache miss, it spends 100ns (= 100 × 10 −9 seconds), at any clock frequency. We assume we can ignore eﬀects of pipeline execution and instruction cache misses. For calculation problems, answers should have two signiﬁcant ﬁgures. (1) CPU A has a direct-mapped cache memory with a capacity of 32,768 (= 2 15) bytes, and the size of a cache block (also called a cache line) is 64 bytes. The CPU uses 32-bit memory address, which is internally split into three parts as shown in the ﬁgure. Answer how many bits are required for tag, index and oﬀset parts, respectively. Note that the index is used to determine the cache block where the memory contents are stored. (2) A program P1 is executed on a computer with CPU A. The clock frequency is 2GHz (= 2 × 10 9Hz). The numbers of instructions included in the execution of P1 are I1: 6 × 10 9I2: 2 × 10 9I3: 1 × 10 9, for each instruction group. The cache miss rate is 20%. Answer the execution time of P1 and the average number of executed instructions per second. (Continued on the next page) 28 (3) We want to make the execution time of P1 on this computer to be 5/6 times of that in (2) or shorter. For this purpose, we consider the two following methods. HW: The clock frequency is changed, while the program is not changed. SW: The program is improved so that the cache miss rate is reduced. We assume the numbers of executed instructions in I1, I2 and I3, respectively, are the same as before. The clock frequency is not changed. Answer the condition on the clock frequency when the method HW is applied. Also answer the condition on the cache miss rate when the method SW is applied. For each method, if it is impossible to achieve the improvement, answer “impossible”. (4) We want to make the execution time of P1 on this computer to be 1/2 times of that in (2) or shorter. Like in (3), when each method of HW or SW is applied, answer the condition for each method. 29","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
